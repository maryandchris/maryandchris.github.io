                <h1><u>About us</u></h1>
                <p>Hello and welcome to our wedding website! We’re glad you’re here :) If you’re interested, we’ve written a quick and semi-self-indulgent recap of our lives together up to this point:
                </p>
                <p>We met almost a decade (!) ago at Charlottesville High School (sophomore year) and became fast friends after we did a physics project together on cosmic microwave background (for fun, you can view the fruits from this earliest extant Chris/Mary collaboration <a href="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1QxGB0OnBx-WUKtS1Svri-IhsUQCaDGHwnRG3YSSS300/edit?usp=sharing">here</a>).
                </p>
                <p>Over the next couple of years, we spent many hours at our high school's science club, worked at “rival” bakeries, attended two proms together, and tried all of C-Ville Knife and Fork's 2016 <a href="https://issuu.com/cvilleweekly/docs/2826.1_knife_fork">30 bargain bites under $10</a>… before deciding to go our separate ways at the beginning of college. 
                </p>
                <p>But next summer (August 12th, 2017) we started dating again, this time long-distance. Fun fact: the commute between University of Chicago and Yale requires many different forms of transportation, including but not necessarily limited to {subway, plane, bus, train, rideshare}. During too-infrequent visits, we met each others’ friends, explored Chicago and New Haven together, and ate a lot of really tasty food.
                </p>
                <p>Between visits, we talked on the phone and studied for our classes together.
                </p>
                <p>In Fall of 2020, after our graduations, we began a different (easier) long distance relationship between New Haven (Chris) and Cambridge (Mary). In the height of the pandemic, our visits included more cooking and long cold walks outside, but they sustained us that winter, and we both felt certain that we wanted to be together for the rest of our lives.  And finally, in Summer of 2021, Chris moved to Cambridge that fall, and we were finally reunited!! 
                </p>
                <p>Almost exactly 5 years (Aug 13th, 2021) after we decided to “give long distance a try,” Chris proposed. And now we are looking forward to celebrating our marriage with you, all our beloved friends and family. These relationships are our greatest treasure!
